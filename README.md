### What?
Noisy is a random audio noise generator for OS X. It is based on “Noise” by Blackhole Media. It was maintained anonymously at http://code.google.com/p/noisy/, and is now maintained at [xj9/Noisy].

### Why?
Does your coworker use a gigantic, over-engineered, mechanically switched keyboard that, when he gets up to speed, sounds like a train wrecking? Do people like to chit-chat next to you while you’re trying to work? Do high school students walk past your window every day shouting at each other so loudly that you’re certain they must be about to start a brawl, and do you, every day, go to the window to investigate only to discover that’s just how they communicate normally with each other? Are you otherwise easily distracted?

A little bit of static noise in your headphones can make the rest of the world seem a lot further away.
